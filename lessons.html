                <h2>My Philosophy as a Guitarist & Instructor</h2>
                <div class="philosophy-content">
                    <p>Music is not just about playing the right notes—it's about understanding the "why" behind those notes and expressing your unique voice as a musician. My approach combines technical excellence with creative freedom, grounded in a deep understanding of music theory and its real-world applications.</p>
                    <p>I believe every student, regardless of age or experience level, has the potential to become a confident, versatile musician. My years working with students of all ages have taught me how to adapt my teaching style to match each person's learning pace and musical goals. Whether you're a complete beginner or an advanced player looking to expand your horizons, I'm here to guide you on your musical journey.</p>
                    <p>In my lessons, we focus on building skills that last—critical listening, problem-solving, and musical intuition. You'll learn not just how to play, but how to think like a musician and make informed, creative decisions in any musical situation.</p>
